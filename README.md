The "Pet Adoption Web Application" aims to create a user-friendly platform that facilitates the
adoption process for pets by connecting rescue organizations with potential adopters. With a
comprehensive user interface, the web application serves two primary purposes - an engaging platform
for general users seeking to adopt pets and an efficient administrative dashboard for recognized pet
rescue organizations and individuals involved in pet rescues.
